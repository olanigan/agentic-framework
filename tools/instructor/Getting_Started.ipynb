    "According to the author Jason Liu, Instructor is built on top of Pydantic and OpenAI SDK. The OpenAI SDK has become the de-facto tool for interacting with Language Models. All other LLM API providers like Google, Anthropic, Cohere, Replicate and others provide alternate configuration (i.e. `base_url` and `api_key`) that allows the use of the OpenAI library to communicate with their proprietary Language Models.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Pydantic is a popular Python library for data validation using Python type annotations, making it easy to validate complex data structures and automatically generate JSON schemas. Pydantic has become a critical component for the major Generative AI Python tooling like OpenAI SDK, Langchain, LlamaIndex among others.  It has become a go-to tool for validating input and output data among GenAI developers due to its excellent developer experience, strong type safety, and seamless integration with modern Python applications and frameworks.\n"
